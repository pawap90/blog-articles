Last week I wrote an article explaining [how to create a simple chrome extension](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/creating-a-simple-chrome-extension-36m). Today I'm going to add a new feature to the same extension we built last week: **Keyboard shortcuts**.

We will add two shortcuts: One to open the browser action we created in the previous article and one to duplicate the current tab.  The shortcuts will be `Alt + Shift + 1` and `Alt + Shift + 2`.
Using these 2 examples we will learn how to add different types of shortcuts to our extension.

# Commands API

To create a keyboard shortcut for our extension we must use the **commands API.** Through this API we can define *commands* for our extension and bind them to *keyboard shortcuts*. When someone uses the shortcut, the command will be triggered and the logic we added to the command will be executed.

Commands must be added to the `manifest.json` file along with their suggested keyboard shortcut.  Multiple commands can be defined in the `manifest.json`, however, only 4 shortcuts can be *suggested* by our extension. The user can bind the other commands to a keyboard shortcut from the browser (`chrome://extensions/shortcuts`).

> **Available keys**
> Any keyboard shortcut must use either `Ctrl` (`Command` in Mac) or `Alt` but cannot include both. `Shift` can also be used. Other supported keys: `A-Z`, `0-9`, `Comma`, `Period`, `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `Space`, `Insert`, `Delete`, Arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) and the Media Keys (`MediaNextTrack`, `MediaPlayPause`, `MediaPrevTrack`, `MediaStop`).
> **Examples:** `Ctrl + Shift + L`, `Alt + Shift + L`  `Command + ,`  `Ctrl + Shift + 1`

Keep in mind that you cannot use commands that are already reserved by the browser like `Ctrl + T` (which in Chrome opens a new tab).

The logic that should be executed once the user executes a command should be handled in a *background script*. I'll explain more about this later.

# Let's get coding

## 1. Define the commands in the manifest.json file

To define a command we should use the `commands` property in our `manifest.json` file, like so:

```json
{
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "name": "Acho, where are we?",
    ...
    "commands": {
        "_execute_browser_action": {
            "suggested_key": {
                "default": "Alt+Shift+1"
            }
        },
        "duplicate-tab": {
            "suggested_key": {
                "default": "Ctrl+Shift+1",
                "mac": "Command+Shift+1"
            },
            "description": "Duplicates the currently active tab because... why not?"
        }
    }
}
```

In the previous code we defined 2 different commands:

- `_execute_browser_action`: This is a **reserved **command that will be handled by chrome directly. By defining it in our `manifest.json` all we are doing is telling chrome to open our browser action when the user executes the shortcut. We don't need to handle the logic for this command ourselves.
- `duplicate-tab`: This is a custom command that must be handled manually by our extension. Notice that this command also includes a `description` which is not required for reserved commands (chrome just displays a default description that cannot be overridden).

## 2. Add a background script

To handle the logic for our `duplicate-tab` command we will need a *background script. *Using this script we will listen for the `onCommand` method and execute the appropriate logic.

>**About background scripts**

>Background scripts are used mainly to listen to events from the browser and trigger a reaction.  This scripts will stay running while they perform their tasks after some event was fired and then they will be unloaded.

To include our background script we must modify our `manifest.json` file and define the script using the `background` property, like so:

```json
{
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "name": "Acho, where are we?",
    ...
    "background": {
        "scripts": [
            "background.js"
        ],
        "persistent": false
    }
}
```

Finally, let's add a new file called `background.js` in the route of our project.

## 3. Listen for the command event

For our command to be properly handled, we need to listen to the `onCommand` event in our background script and execute the appropriate logic once our command is called.

So we will listen to the event and call the `duplicateTab` function when the `duplicate-tab` command is called:

```js
chrome.commands.onCommand.addListener(function (command) {
    switch (command) {
        case 'duplicate-tab':
            duplicateTab();
            break;
        default:
            console.log(`Command ${command} not found`);
    }
});

/**
* Gets the current active tab URL and opens a new tab with the same URL.
*/
function duplicateTab() {
    const query = { active: true, currentWindow: true };
    chrome.tabs.query(query, (tabs) => {
        chrome.tabs.create({ url: tabs[0].url, active: false });
    });
}
```

> Notice that I didn't include a `case` for the `_execute_browser_action` command because, as we said before, that command is handled automatically by chrome.

## Done!
Now when the user executes `Alt + Shift + 1` the browser action will be open and when they use the shortcut `Alt + Shift + 2` the current tab will be duplicated.
