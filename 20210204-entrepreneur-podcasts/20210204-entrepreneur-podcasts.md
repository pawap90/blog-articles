I love podcasts. I love them for many reasons, but the most important is the fact that, a few years ago, listening to podcasts gave me the courage to quit my job to start working on my own projects.

I don't even remember how I first got into into it, but somehow I started listening to podcasts about freelancing and entrepreneurship on my bus back home every day after work. Listening to dozens of stories about different people that managed to make a living in unconventional ways and chasing their dreams was really inspiring and eye opening. At that point in my life I had already worked 5 years for a company and was already realizing that I didn't want to do the typical 9 to 5 job. These podcasts were exactly the push I needed to move on.

I still have a long way to go with my career, but I'm really happy with how it's developing so far. 

So I decided to write this post to share some of my favorite podcasts about entrepreneurship in the hope that they inspire you and give you the courage to keep working towards your dreams too:

# 1. Hack the Entrepreneur
I've been listening to HTE for years, I never get tired of it. Every episode the host, Jon Nastor, **intereviews** an entrepreneur. The guests range between solo entrepreneurs and multimillion-dollar startup founders. During these ~40 minute interviews, Jon asks them about their growth, their business, their motivations, etc. 

I found this podcast to be not only inspiring but also really **informative**. The guests are not always from the tech world, so you may think that their interviews won't give you as much value, but I realized it's the opposite. I learned a lot by listening how people from different backgrounds manage their business.

# 2. She Did It Her Way
I came across this postcast recently and was instantly hooked. Most episodes are between 15 and 25 minutes long, and every single minute is *full of valuable content*. 

The host, Amanda Boleyn, talks about business and offers **pragmatic tips** on how to get your own business running. She also does interviews with other women entrepreneurs who talk about their story, how they became entrepreneurs and their business.

# The Ground Up Show
One of the things I got interested in when I started thinking on working independently was *minimalism*. Many freelancers, digital-nomads and entrepreneurs use minimalismn to reduce their cost of living and to focus on what's important. 

Matt D'Avella was the filmmaker behind Netflix documentary about Minimalism, and later started THe Ground Up Show.

In this podcast Matt meets with creatives and interviews them about their content and their business. 

You can also watch the interviews in YouTube, if you prefer.

# 4. Company of One
The Company of One podcasts has only 21 episodes, and they're all great. What I love about this podcast it's how it shows you how business can succeed by *challenging the common belief that bigger is better.* It's really interesting to see how small business can apply creative solutions to solve their issues and succeed.

The host is Paul Jarvis, author of "Company of One: Why Staying Small Is the Next Big Thing for Business". Episodes range between 5 and 15 minutes long and will leave you thinking
