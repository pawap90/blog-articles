I love podcasts. I love them for many reasons, but the most important is that a few years ago, listening to podcasts helped me find the motivation I needed to start working on my own projects.

I don't even remember how I first got into it, but somehow I started listening to podcasts about freelancing and entrepreneurship on my bus back home every day after work. Listening to hundreds of stories about different people who managed to make a living in unconventional ways and chasing their dreams was really inspiring and eye-opening. At that point in my life, I had already worked 5 years for a company and was realizing that I didn't want to do the typical 9 to 5 job. These podcasts were precisely the push I needed to move on.

I still have a long way to go with my career, but I'm really happy with how it's developing so far. 

So I decided to write this post to share some of my favorite podcasts about entrepreneurship in the hope that they inspire you and give you the courage to keep working towards your dreams too:

# 1. Hack the Entrepreneur
I've been listening to HTE for years. I never get tired of it. Every episode, the host, Jon Nastor, **interviews** an entrepreneur. The guests range between solo entrepreneurs and multimillion-dollar startup founders. During these ~40 minute interviews, Jon asks them about their growth, business, motivations, etc. 

I found this podcast to be not only inspiring but also really **informative**. The guests are not always from the tech world, so you may think that their interviews won't give you as much value, but I realized it's the opposite. I learned a lot by listening to how people from different backgrounds manage their business.

# 2. She Did It Her Way
I came across this podcast recently and was instantly hooked. Most episodes are between 15 and 25 minutes long, and every single minute is *full of valuable content*. 

The host, Amanda Boleyn, talks about business and offers **practical tips** on how to get your own business running. She also interviews other women entrepreneurs who talk about their stories, how they became entrepreneurs, and their businesses.

# The Ground Up Show
One of the things I got interested in when I started thinking about freelancing was *minimalism*. Many freelancers, digital nomads, and entrepreneurs use minimalism to reduce their living costs and focus on what's important to them. 

Matt D'Avella was the filmmaker behind the Netflix documentary about minimalism and later started The Ground Up Show.

In this podcast, Matt meets with creatives and interviews them about their content and their businesses. 

You can also watch the interviews on YouTube if you prefer.

# 4. Company of One
The Company of One podcast has only 21 episodes, and they're all great. What I love about this podcast it's how it shows you how business can succeed by *challenging the common belief that bigger is better.* It's fascinating to see how small businesses can apply creative solutions to solve their issues and succeed.

The host is Paul Jarvis, author of "Company of One: Why Staying Small Is the Next Big Thing for Business." Episodes range between 5 and 15 minutes long and will leave you thinking.
